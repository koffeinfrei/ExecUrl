# URL: Must contain the placeholder {0}, where the parameter will be placed
# If the last part is omitted, the system default browser is used to open the url
#
# And in case you wonder why the configuration isn't done nicely with xml or something, the 
# answer is that xml is massive overhead, and I like to keep things as simple as possible.
#
# The entries will be available through global hotkeys according to their order defined herein CTRL + <0-9>
