Koffeinfrei.ExecUrl
-------------------

This tool provides a list of customizable URLs in the system tray. Those URLs each contain a placeholder for a parameter. This parameter can be typed each time the URL is called, either by clicking on the tray menu item or by using its global hotkey. After the parameter is typed, the URL opens in the browser.

-------------------

The global hotkeys for each list item are CTRL + <the number preceding the item, on the numeric keyboard block>

The shortcut "CTRL + -" opens the context menu.
